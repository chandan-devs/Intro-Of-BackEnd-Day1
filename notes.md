BACKEND TECHNOLOGIES ARE :
node.js
python
golang
PHP
Ruby

In backend we have a servers understands node.js 

Two things are there in backend:

1.Servers :- computers without a screen or without GUI which servers something.

2.Database :- data and base the place where data resides are called as database. ex: chat , password  or etc

Servers are use to serves a data from database.

Browser [google.com](https://www.google.com)------> Servers------> Database

They all connects to each other through API(via internet)

Language of the Internet is called API(Application Programming Interface).

API is the set of rules.

These are all the jargans of BackEnd.

Programming is a set rules that we create to tell a computer to do something.

C,C++,Java,Python,Javascript etc.

In Jvascript we have a event loop it create a quee its divides a solution into a small small thing that 0-1 1-5 5-10 as more.....

Javascript is single threded but is uses something called event loop that makes it possible to haddle the 1 millions user at a time.

Javascrip is easy to understand and v.good developers community(created packages/library) and less to read code ,it does not uses al part of the system it uses event loop to bring all the functionality that is called as node.js

Around  60% of caompanies are using node.js why other 40% are not using because they are trying to solve some other problems i.e

Node.js is require to handle traffic bit not to handle a Big rows data or we need some heavy calculation which requires very low level codding then you require c,c++,java,Ruby etc they are very close to 01010 they are low level language to make it faster.
